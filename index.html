      <p>
        Abdus Salam, a Pakistani theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, was <b>born in Jhang, Punjab, Pakistan</b> on <b><i>January 29, 1926</i></b>, and passed away in Oxford, England on November 21, 1996. He is best known for his work on the unified theory of electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force, for which he shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. <br><br>
        Salam was scientific advisor to the Ministry of Science and Technology in Pakistan from 1960 to 1974, a position from which he played a major and influential role in the development of the country's science infrastructure. Salam contributed to numerous developments in theoretical and particle physics in Pakistan. He was the founding director of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), and responsible for the establishment of the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG). For this, he is viewed as the "scientific father" of this program.In 1974, Abdus Salam departed from his country in protest after the Parliament of Pakistan unanimously passed a parliamentary bill declaring members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, to which Salam belonged, non-Muslim.[17]

      <p>
        Dr. Abdus Salam won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, specifically for his contribution to the electroweak theory. This theory, which he developed with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg, describes how the weak and electromagnetic forces are unified at high energies. Salam's work was crucial in the development of the Standard Model of particle physics. 
        <br><br>
 <h3><b>Detailed Information:</b></h3> 
<b>The Electroweak Theory:</b> <br>
Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg independently developed the theory that combines the weak nuclear force and electromagnetism into a single electroweak force. This theory, which is a cornerstone of the Standard Model, explained how these two forces are interconnected at high energies. <br><br>
<b>Prediction of the Weak Neutral Current:</b> <br>
The electroweak theory, as developed by Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg, predicted the existence of a weak neutral current, which was later experimentally confirmed. This prediction was a major triumph of the theory. <br><br>
<b>Salam's Specific Contributions:</b> <br>
Salam played a key role in incorporating the Higgs mechanism into the electroweak theory. This mechanism, which was also co-discovered by his Imperial College colleague Tom Kibble, is essential for explaining how particles acquire mass. <br><br>
<b>The Higgs Boson:</b> <br>
Salam and Weinberg, in their electroweak theory, identified most of the properties of the Higgs boson, including its interactions, except for its mass. The Higgs boson, later discovered at CERN in 2012, is a fundamental particle that explains how particles acquire mass, and its discovery validated the electroweak theory. <br><br> 
<b>Impact on Particle Physics:</b> <br>
Salam's work, along with that of Glashow and Weinberg, was instrumental in shaping our understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that make up the universe. The electroweak theory is a crucial part of the Standard Model, which describes the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions.

                    The unification of fundamental forces is the goal of describing all four known fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force) as different aspects of a single force or theory. Scientists believe that these forces were unified in the early universe and may still be unified at very high energies. <br>
  
            <b><b>The Four Fundamental Forces:</b></b>
            <b><li>Gravity:</b> The force of attraction between objects with mass.</li>
            <b><li>Electromagnetism:</b> The force between electrically charged particles.</li>
            <b><li>Weak Nuclear Force:</b> The force responsible for certain types of radioactive decay and is involved in nuclear reactions.</li>

    <h2 style="font-size: xx-large; font-family: felix-titling;">SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>Dr. Abdus Salam (1926-1996) was a Pakistani theoretical physicist, a Nobel laureate, and the first Pakistani and first Muslim to receive a Nobel Prize in the sciences. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Lee Glashow and Steven Weinberg for their work on the electroweak theory, which unified the weak nuclear force and electromagnetism. <br><br>
    Salam's contributions to physics were significant, particularly his work on the electroweak theory, where he predicted the existence of neutral currents, which were later confirmed experimentally. He also played a crucial role in establishing the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy, which aimed to support physicists from developing countries and became a leading research hub. <br><br>
    Salam's legacy extends beyond his scientific achievements. He was a strong advocate for science education and development in developing countries, and he urged governments in the South to invest in science and technology to promote economic development. He also served as a scientific advisor to the President of Pakistan, contributing to the development of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and the Pakistan space program. <br><br>
    Despite his international recognition, Dr. Salam faced controversy in Pakistan, particularly after being declared a non-Muslim due to his Ahmadi faith. </p>
